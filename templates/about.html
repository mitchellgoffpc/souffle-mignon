                        Souffl&eacute; Mignon is a blog run by
                        Mitchell Goff and Gabby Moreno, both lifelong residents of
                        the Sol system, since January of 2017. It is known mostly
                        for its humor, its numerous xkcd references, and for being
                        a huge waste of everyone's time.

                        native to North America. He is most commonly found in the
                        digital arts lab at Dartmouth College, where he studies
                        Computer Science, although he migrates seasonally to the
                        coastal areas of California as his budget allows. His
                        favorite color is the shade of those pretty orange flecks
                        in Gabby's eyes, but denim blue is a close second.
                        In his spare time he likes making butterscotch cookies
                        and playing Elton John songs over and over and over
                        until everyone gets sick of them. On rare occasions
                        he can be spotted in the wild, where his preferred
                        activities include rock climbing, mountain biking, and
                        kayaking. He is currently 21 years old.

                        Try saying that five times fast without sounding pretentious.
                        Doesn't like it when things are pronounced incorrectly
                        yet will go out of her way to pronounce things in a subtly
                        annoying way like saying /suh-poh-sub-ly/ instead of
                        supposedly. Had perfect attendance since pre-school.
                        No, seriously. Her favourite color is blue but not
                        like a light blue, it has to be like a midnight
                        blue. Part time Question Asker, full-time professional
